# Checkup ledger

Tracks due status and open findings for the two-tier periodic code-quality checkup defined in [ADR-0001](../decisions/ADR-0001-two-tier-periodic-code-quality-checkup.md). `scripts/checkup/due.py` reads the **Cadence & due status** table below to report which tier(s) are due; the `/checkup` skill updates this file after each run.

## Cadence & due status

Each tier is tracked as "not yet done this period" — a period label, not an exact-day match — so it stays flagged as overdue until actually run (see ADR-0001). `Period covered` is the period label (`YYYY-MM` for light, `YYYY-Qn` for heavy) of the most recently completed run.

| Tier | Cadence | Last run | Period covered | Next due |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Light | 1st of every calendar month | never | — | — |
| Heavy | 14th of Jan/Apr/Jul/Oct | never | — | — |

## Open findings

Findings needing human decision or larger effort, each carrying an explicit deadline — no individual PM ticket is filed (per ADR-0001). Classified using [Fowler's Technical Debt Quadrant](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebtQuadrant.html) before being written up.
